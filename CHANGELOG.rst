0.0.3 (2019-03-18)
==================

This release focuses on refining the user experience of creating a file or project from Slack using the ``templatekit.yaml`` configuration files introduced in Templatekit 0.2.0.

- In the initial template selection menus, template names and groupings are derived from ``templatekit.yaml`` configurations.
  Templates are now better organized and better labeled!

- Fields in the dialog are driven by the ``dialog_fields`` field in ``templatekit.yaml`` configurations (Templatekit will still provide a default set of fields if none are set).
  These configurations, defined in Templatekit 0.2.0+ allow for exciting UI features like labels, placeholders, and hints.
  The schema validator in Templatekit ensures that labels aren't too long, and that there aren't too many dialog fields â€” this makes the dialog implementation in Templatebot much simpler.

  These configurations also introduce the concept of *preset menus*, which combine multiple cookiecutter variable presets into selection menu options.
  This feature lets us handle complicated templates, which many boolean or constrained option variables, within the five-field limit imposed by Slack dialogs.

- This release also includes a handler for project templates, though only as a proof-of-concept for showing that cookiecutter variables for complex templates like ``stack_package`` can be successfully captured.

0.0.2 (2019-03-12)
==================

This release focuses on file template creation  (``@sqrbot-jr create file``):

- A new ``RepoManager`` class manages clones of the template repository (a Git repo).
  The ``RepoManager`` caches clones by Git SHA and clones are immutable.
  What this means is that one handler can be rendering a template from the ``master`` branch while a new handler sees that ``master`` is updated and begins a new clone of ``master``.

- The file template handler now populates the Slack dialog with actual fields from the template's ``cookiecutter.json`` file and renders the actual template with templatekit.
  The filename is also rendered from the cookiecutter context.

0.0.1 (2019-02-21)
==================

This is the initial proof-of-concept of Templatebot.
It implements a SQuaRE Events (Kafka) listener and mocks up an interaction with a Slack-based user creating a file template.
Templatebot opens a Slack dialog to get specific information needed by a template, and then uploads the generated file back to the channel. `See this PR for a demo gif <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/templatebot/pull/1#issuecomment-466219231>`__.
